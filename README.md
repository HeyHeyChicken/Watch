**Watch** is a small challenge (inspired from [Dribbble](//dribbble.com/shots/14213491-watch)) that I wanted to take up.<br/>
The animation is only done in CSS. The JS is only used to set the watch to the current time.<br/>
([live demo](//codepen.io/antoinecuffel/pen/PozYdXb)).<br/>

## Usage

Have a look at the <code>/index.html</code> file to see how it works.
